# ES6 JavaScript Exercises

This repository contains a collection of ES6 JavaScript exercises. Each exercise focuses on a specific feature or concept of ES6. Below is a brief description of each exercise.

## Exercise 1: Parameter Destructuring

In this exercise, you learn how to use parameter destructuring to extract values from objects and arrays.

## Exercise 2: Object Property Assignment

This exercise demonstrates the usage of shorthand property assignment and computed property names to simplify object property assignment.

## Exercise 3: Parameter Defaults

In this exercise, you learn how to use default parameter values to provide fallback values for function arguments.

## Exercise 4: Rest Parameter Syntax for Functions

This exercise shows how to use the rest parameter syntax to capture multiple function arguments as an array.

## Exercise 5: The Wonders of Spread Syntax

In this exercise, you explore the spread syntax and learn how it can be used to concatenate arrays and strings.

## Exercise 6: String Interpolation

This exercise demonstrates how to use template literals for string interpolation, allowing variables to be substituted directly into strings.

## Exercise 7: Object Property Value Shorthand Syntax

In this exercise, you learn about the shorthand syntax for object property values, which allows you to use the key name directly as the variable name.

## Exercise 8: No Need to Create Empty Objects

This exercise shows how to use computed property names to dynamically set properties on an object.

## Exercise 9: ES6 Method Properties

In this exercise, you explore ES6 method properties and learn how to define methods directly in object literals.

## Exercise 10: For...of Loops

This exercise demonstrates the usage of the for...of loop to iterate over arrays and other iterable objects.

## Exercise 11: Iterator

In this exercise, you learn how to create an iterator object and use it to iterate over employees in different departments.

## Exercise 12: Let's Create a Report Object

This exercise involves creating a report object that contains information about employees in various departments.

## Exercise 13: Iterating Through Objects

In this exercise, you learn how to create an iterator object and use it to iterate through every employee in every department of a report object.

## Exercise 14: Iterate Through Object

This exercise demonstrates how to iterate through the iterator object and obtain a string containing all employee names separated by '|'.
